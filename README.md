## Introduction
 
 This is the code repository to reproduce the experiments in the paper [A New Data Complexity Measure for Multi-class Imbalanced Classification Tasks] (Submitted to Pattern Recognition). We implement our methods with Matlab2019a, including toolbox libsvm-3.24. 

## Contents

 data complexity measures for imbalanced classification tasks.

## Complexity measures types
 
 1. initial measures 

 2. imbalance degrees

 3. decomposed class complexity measures: the class version of initial measures

 4. weighted decomposed class complexity measuresï¼š the combinations of decomposed class complexity measures (same measures + classes weights)

 5. the combination of [3] weighted decomposed class complexity measures (various measures + weights)

 6. MFII

## Effectiveness validation
 
 1. Spearman Pearson coefficients
 2. DoC
 3. VoR 

## Classifiers used
 1. CART
 2. KNN
 3. SVM
 4. NB
 5. DAC
 6. AdaBoost
 7. RF
